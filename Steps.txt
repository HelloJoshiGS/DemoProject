Chunk 2: Database Setup
    1: Choose and set up the database (MongoDB / Firebase / PostgreSQL)
    2: Define database schema/model for expenses (amount, category, date, description, etc.)
    3: Connect the backend to the database
    4: Test database connection

Chunk 3: Expense APIs (CRUD Operations)
    1: Create API to add an expense (POST /expenses)
    2: Create API to update an expense (PUT /expenses/:id)
    3: Create API to delete an expense (DELETE /expenses/:id)
    4: Create API to fetch all expenses (GET /expenses)

Chunk 4: Filtering and Query Options
    1: Implement filtering expenses by date range (GET /expenses?startDate=xx&endDate=xx)
    2: Implement filtering expenses by category (GET /expenses?category=food)
    3: Implement sorting expenses by amount or date
    4: Optimize database queries for better performance

Chunk 5: API Security & Validation
    1: Validate request payloads (Ensure required fields like amount, category)
    2: Implement rate limiting (Prevent spam API requests)
    3: Secure API routes with authentication (JWT/Auth Middleware)
    4: Implement error handling & response standardization
